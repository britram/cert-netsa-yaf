 * This creates a really simple hash table to store a mapping between
 * port numbers and rules.  The hash is really an implementation of
 * a sparse array.
 *
 * Also in the hash table are the DPI rules and index numbers to the
 * structures defined in dpacketplugin.c.  Try to avoid collisions by
 * not using well-known ports used in the applabel plug-in:
 * 80, 22, 25, 6346, 5050, 53, 21, 443, 427, 143, 194
