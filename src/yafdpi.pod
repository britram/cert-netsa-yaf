=head1 NAME

B<yaf deep packet inspection>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<yaf> can examine packet payloads, capture useful information for a specific protocol, and export it in a protocol-specific template within B<yaf's> SubTemplateMultiList if B<yaf> is built with plugin support enabled (using the B<--enable-plugins> option to ./configure).  It may be necessary to set the LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable if the plugins were installed in a nonstandard location.

The DPI plugin requires payload capture to be enabled with the B<--max-payload> option.  A minimum payload capture length of 384 octets is recommended for best results. B<--applabel> is also required, as the application label determines how the inspection will execute.

DPI in B<yaf> is directly related to application labeling as it will only perform DPI if a match was found during the application labeling phase, and it will only execute an inspection specific to the protocol denoted by the application label.

In order to enable DPI in B<yaf> the following should be added to the command line:

=over 2

C<--plugin-name=/usr/local/lib/yaf/dpacketplugin.la>

=back

You can also add the option switch to specify which protocols to perform DPI:

=over 2

C<--plugin-opts="53 80 21">

=back

The above will perform DPI for DNS, HTTP, and FTP.

DPI operates differently depending on whether the protocol is plugin-based or regex-based in the yafApplabelRules.conf file.  If the protocol uses a regex rule for application labeling, it will have a list of regular expressions in the yafDPIIRules.conf file that are compared against the captured payload.  Any matches are stored and later exported in an IPFIX information element.  If the protocol is based on a plugin rule, it will store important information while it is decoding the payload using the dynamically loaded plugin listed in the yafApplabelRules.conf file.  See the source code to the plugins included with B<yaf> for details on the specific protocol implementations.  Some plugins will allow
configurable deep packet inspection from the yafDPIRules.conf file,
such as DNP 3.0, Ethernet/IP, and SCADA.  See below for specific information
on these particular protocols.

In order to perform DPI on DNSSEC resource records, add "DNSSEC" to the
B<--plugin-opts> option:

=over 2

C<--plugin-opts=DNSSEC>

C<--plugin-opts="DNSSEC 53">

=back

=head1 DPI CONFIG FILE FORMAT


The yafDPIRules.conf file should be in the same location as the yafApplabelRules.conf file.  The file follows a similar format to yafApplabelRules.conf.  The file is a list of label, element pair statements.  A label statement begins with the keyword 'label', and has the following form:

=over 2

label <N> element <N2> <element-rule>

=back

where <N> is the application label (usually the well-known port) found in the yafApplabelRules.conf file (an unsigned 16-bit decimal integer in the range 0 to 65535), <N2> is the Information Element ID found in the F</usr/local/yaf/CERT_IE.h> and below, and <element-rule> is a PCRE regular expression and will be stored and associated with the ID number preceding it.  There can be multiple lines for a single application label, however each should have a different <N2>.  There should be parentheses around the substring you want to capture and store.  If there is more than 1 set of parentheses in the regular expression, the most outer set is the substring captured.  (See PCRE documentation for details on regular expressions and substring matching.)

=head3 User Defined Elements

To define your own information elements, use the following form:

=over 2

label <N> user <E> name <element-name> <element-rule>

=back

where <N> is the application label found in yafApplabelRules.conf file. <E> is the Information Element ID in the range of 0 to 65535 to be given to the element upon export.  This number should be unique to this file and should NOT be defined in F</usr/local/yaf/CERT_IE.h>.  This element will be added to the template upon processing of this file, and must be added to the B<yaf> collecting process in order to properly decode the IPFIX message.  <element-name> is the name you want to give to this IPFIX Information Element.  This name can consist of letters and numbers and underscores; it can not contain special characters or spaces.  <label-rule> is the PCRE regular expression and will be stored and associated with the Information Element ID and name preceding it.  There is a limit of 30 additional fields per protocol that YAF will store and execute.  To find out if B<yaf> accepted your elements, run B<yaf> with --verbose.  All user elements will be exported using the CERT Private Enterprise Number (PEN) 6871.  ONLY user labels for protocols FTP, HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, RTSP, SSH, and SIP will be added.  Elements will be added to the template in the order they are
listed in the yafDPIRules.conf file in the form of an fbBasicList_t.  By default,
HTTP exports 20 basicLists, FTP exports 5 basicLists, IMAP exports 7 basicLists,
RTSP exports 12 basicLists, SIP exports 7 basicLists, SMTP exports 11 basicLists,
and 1 basicList is exported for SSH.

A "#" smybol starts a comment for the entire line.
If a rule is not properly formatted, all subsequent rules may not be processed.
It is acceptable to comment out any B<yaf> DPI rules. B<yaf> rules commented out will not be executed against the payload but they will still exist in the template and record.  User-defined information elements are added based on the configuration file at run time.

Optionally, this file may contain two limit statements to configure the DPI plugin.
A limit statement begins with the keyword 'limit', and has the following form:

=over 2

limit [field|total] <limit-value>

=back

If the "field" label is present, the <limit-value> will be the number of bytes B<yaf> will export for
any given field in this file.  This does not affect the DNS Deep Packet Inspection or SSL Certificate Capture.
FOr DNS, a domain name can have a maximum of 255 characters, so the limit is not configurable.

If the "total" field is present, the <limit-value> will be the total number of bytes B<yaf> may export
from the DPI plugin. Obviously, this number will not be larger than the --max-payload value B<yaf> is given
at run time.

Both the field and total limits have a maximum value of 65535.  If they are larger, they will revert back
to the defaults of 200 for per-field limit and 1000 for total limit.

There are also 2 configuration parameters related to SSL export.  By default, B<yaf>
parses the X.509 certificates and exports the information described below under SSL/TLS.
If the following line is present:

=over 2

cert_export_enabled = 1

=back

B<yaf> will export the full X.509 certificate in the format described below under 
Full Certificate Export.  Setting
this variable to 1 disables the traditional SSL certificate decode and export.  If the second
configuration variable is present:

=over 2

cert_hash_enabled = 1

=back

B<yaf> will export the hash of the X.509 certificate as found in the certificate. 
This is typically the SHA-256 hash of the binary certificate but it can vary
on the hashing algorithm used.  The hashing algorithm can be identified by the sslCertSignature
field.  If both cert_export_enabled and cert_hash_enabled are set to 1, B<yaf>
will export both the full X.509 certificate and perform the traditional decode
of the X.509 certificate. It is not recommended to do both.  If cert_export_enabled
is set to 1, B<super_mediator> can perform the extraction of relevant fields as is
done by B<yaf>, plus it provides the option to perform SHA-1 or MD5 hashes of the
certificate.


=head1 DPI in Action

Upon B<yaf> startup and capture, you will be able to see if the rule files and their regular expressions were accepted using the B<--verbose> flag.

=back

An unacceptable regular expression will be brought to your attention with the above statements.  If you choose certain protocols for inspection using the C<--plugin-opts> flag, only the appropriate rule statements will be loaded into the DPI Rule Scanner.

=head1 Configure Options

The following options can be given to ./configure when B<yaf> is built to export DNS authoritative and NXDomain Responses only.

=over 2

=item B<--enable-exportDNSAuth>

Enable export of DNS Authoritative Responses only.  The default is to capture and export all DNS Responses.  This flag can be used in conjunction with B<--enable-exportDNSNXDomain.> It is only recognized if B<--plugin-name> is set to the DPI plugin, application labeling is enabled, and B<--max-payload> is set.

=item B<--enable-exportDNSNXDomain>

Enable export of DNS NXDomain Responses only.  The default is to capture and export all DNS Responses.  This flag can be used in conjunction with B<--enable-exportDNSAuth>.  It is

=head1 DPI Data Export

=head2  DPI Templates & Information Elements by Protocol

B<yaf>'s output consists of an IPFIX message stream.  B<yaf> uses a variety of templates for IPFIX data records; As of B<yaf> 2.0, B<yaf> uses a subTemplateMultiList to export optional information elements, such as Deep Packet Inspection fields, relating to the flow.  Below are templates that may appear in this subTemplateMultiList depending on the application label of the flow.
For more information on B<yaf> information elements see B<yaf(1)>.  For more information on IPFIX Structured lists, see the Internet Draft, Export of Structured Data in IPFIX, <RFC 6313>.  Most of the elements are exported as a basicList. An IPFIX basicList represents a list of zero or more instances of any Information Element (IE 291).

=head2 FTP

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Deep Packet Inspection is based on RFC 959.
The following information elements are exported as a template
in the subTemplateMultiList as basicLists of variable length
elements in the order they are listed in the yafDPIRules.conf file.
YAF will always export at least 5 basicLists for FTP, even if not
all of the following are enabled.
By default, they will be in the following order:

=over 2

=head2 DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) Deep Packet Inspection is based on RFC 1035.  DNS Information is exported in the B<yaf> subTemplateMultiList as a subTemplateList of Resource Record Templates.  Each resource record entry contains generic resource record information such as type, TTL, and name.  There is also one element (subTemplateList) that contains resource record specific information based on the type of resource record (A Record vs NS Record, for example).  The subTemplateList will contain one entry for each resource record in the packet.  Due to alignment issues, the resource record specific element is the first element in the template and is therefore the first item listed below. DNSSEC information is
not exported by default.  To export DNSSEC information, run B<yaf> with B<--plugin-opts=DNSSEC>.  The following information elements exist in the DNS resource record subTemplateList:

=head3 DNS Resource Record

The following elements (in order) are contained in the DNS Resource Record Template.

=over 3

=item B<subTemplateList> IE 292, variable length

An IPFIX subTemplateList.  This list contains a "DNS Resource Record Type" Template.  The type of this template depends on the type (B<dnsQRType>) of resource record.  See the DNS Resource Record Types listed below.
