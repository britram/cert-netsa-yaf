Brian Trammell originally created YAF and lead overall design. Chris Inacio
built the plugin interface and the included plugins, 
banner grabbing and is the current primary maintainer, and Michael Duggan
contributed to the development of YAF's packet decoder.

Thanks to the organizers and participants of the IPFIX Interoperability Events 
sponsored by IPS-MoME in Salzburg, Austria in March 2006 and by Fraunhofer 
FOKUS in Berlin, Germany in November 2006 for helping to ensure YAF's 
interoperability with other IPFIX implementations.

Thanks to Tony Cebzanov, Michael Duggan, and Sidney Faber for testing, as well.
